# U07AngularMovieApp
## To get app started:
### Clone repository with git clone
### Use command "npm install"
### Use command "ng serve --open" to get app up in browser

## OBS to Cicely!
### This is the functional but simple version of the assignment and the version that I´m actually turning in, I did however work on a bit more advanced version especially with the search function, would be glad if you could have a look at that and tell me what I did wrong and why I didn´t get the search function to work in that one. Many thanks in advance!
